<b>Author:</b> I was completely bored that time when I had this idea in mind that, I should make a shitty bot and I was like "mhmmm should I?" then I've been thinking, what should the bot's main purpose? 3 hours later, I started looking for an API for me to use on a BOT for its main purpose but on my mind, it just sparked "Why not an image manipulating bot?" REEEEE I dunno canvas but mhmm Jimp(https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) eh I guess  this will do. STORY END!<br><br>
